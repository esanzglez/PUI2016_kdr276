# PUI 2016 HW6 - Kelsey Reid

## Assignment One - Energy Consumption Skeleton Notebook

Downloaded datasets into PUIdata - worked with homework group Will Xia, Marc Toneatto, Matt Sloane, Ozgur Akkas, shared group emails to confirm we could all download datasets to this directory

Used pandas.to_numeric function as suggested in class to convert values for Site EUI(kBtu/ft2) and Reported Property Floor Area (Building(s))(ft2)
(http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.to_numeric.html)

Found sample code on Stackoverflow to rename the column for BBL to merge data sets (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20868394/changing-a-specific-column-name-in-pandas-dataframe)
Confirmed syntax for pandas.merge inside Jupyter notebook by way of placing a '?' after the function, confirmed syntax of dataframe, dataframe, on = (common key)


Confirmed how to interpret the Chi-squared test, document obtained by Will Xia (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj4nvKgseXPAhVTET4KHYA5A2sQFggvMAM&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.runet.edu%2F~biol-web%2Fstats%2Fchi-sq_explanation.doc&usg=AFQjCNH03NP-bgCKFYxa-gko0ezuWeKp_Q&sig2=M476Wb5DOeDv8jHUjecHhQ) - the size of your chi-squared value represents the difference between the data and your model. The results of the test showed that the model for energy vs units is better

Referenced code Will Xia worked with Yao Wang on. Our homework group discussed the process and evenly worked together to trouble shoot and understand formulas. 

## Assignment Two - Complete Citi Bike Mini Project

Recreated Assignment 2 from Week 3 Citi Bike project to downloaded data to PUIdata correctly. Marc took the lead on writing the report and we worked as a group to review and confirm the final version.
