## Assignment One - Tracking Each Vehicle For a Line:

For this assignment I created a python script file that takes 2 arguments to report MTA API data of the number and location of buses of a given bus line. The first argument being the MTA key assigned to the specific user and the second being the desired bus line. 

Once I obtained my key I requested data from the BusTime API server and copied the data into a JSON formatter to better understand the hierarchy of nested dictionaries and lists. Once I could understand the specific keys to the information I wanted to report, I was able to make a print statement to print the information for the chosen bus line. I then created a loop with a counter to print a total of buses active on the chosen line and a loop to report the longitude and latitude of each active bus. Once I was confident the code ran properly I replaced my key and bus line information in the url with variables to represent the arguments to be passed from the command line.
