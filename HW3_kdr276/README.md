## Assignment Two - CitiBike Data Data-Driven Inference:

## Assignment Three - Z-Test Lab

I formulated a null and alternative hypothesis regarding the change in bus commute times. The alternative hypothesis being what I expected to be true and the null hypothesis being the opposite I would try to reject based on further statistical tests.
Information on the mean and standard deviation of the old commute time data was provided in the lecture slides along with the sample size (which was also confirmed by openeing and reviewing the times.txt information)
I used the .mean() function to determine the mean of the sample which was rounded up to 34.5 and entered that into the z test formual to obtain a result of 2.5
This result was further than 2 signmas away from the old mean which allowed us to reject the null hypothesis.
